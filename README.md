# Analog-Calculator-with-Potentiometers-and-Joystick-Control
## This Arduino-based calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using two potentiometers and a joystick for input, with results displayed on an LCD screen. The project demonstrates an interactive and analog approach to mathematical computation without traditional buttons or a keypad.

### Potentiometer Inputs: The two potentiometers control the values of the first and second numbers, with ranges mapped for specific input scales.
### Joystick Operation Selector: The joystick's directional controls allow users to select an operation:
####     Up for addition
####     Down for subtraction
####     Left for multiplication
####     Right for division
### LCD Display: The LCD shows the selected operation and calculated result. Division by zero is handled gracefully, displaying an error message when necessary.
This project is a fun and educational exploration of analog inputs for digital calculations, suitable for beginners and enthusiasts looking to expand their understanding of embedded systems and user interfaces.
